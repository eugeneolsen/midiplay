# Active Context
## Current Focus
Phase 3: Integration & Device Testing - COMPLETE

## Recent Changes
*   Phase 3 Part 1: DeviceManager tests (8 test cases, 37 assertions) - COMPLETE
*   Phase 3 Part 2: Integration tests (10 test cases, 36 assertions) - COMPLETE
*   Created 6 test fixture YAML files for DeviceManager testing
*   Fixed path consistency across all test files (test/fixtures â†’ fixtures)
*   Used real cxxmidi::player::PlayerSync instead of FakePlayerSync
*   All 74 test cases passing (321 assertions total) - 100% pass rate

## Open Issues

## Key Learnings
*   Lambda captures by reference in callbacks can cause dangling references when captured objects go out of scope
*   Options class contains char** argv_ pointer that shouldn't be copied - requires careful lifetime management
*   Callback lifecycle must be managed defensively: clear in resetState(), after Load(), in destructor, and in error paths
*   getopt() uses global state (optind) that must be reset (optind=0) before each test for proper isolation
*   Using optind=0 (GNU complete reinitialization) is more reliable than optind=1 (POSIX) for test isolation
*   Test execution order can expose state pollution issues - always verify tests pass in random order
*   Modern C++ libraries like CLI11 eliminate global state issues and provide better type safety

## Next Steps
*   Update source control with Phase 3 completion
*   Update test documentation (README.md)
*   Consider adding hardware integration tests in future (optional)
*   Phase 3 complete - all planned testing implemented

## Recent Accomplishments
*   Corrected UNIT_TESTING_STRATEGY.md Phase 2 status (lines 3360-3365 were incorrectly marked complete)
*   Created test/test_ritardando_effector.cpp with real PlayerSync integration tests (7 tests, 21 assertions)
*   Created test/test_musical_director.cpp with real PlayerSync integration tests (5 tests, 19 assertions)
*   Created test/test_playback_orchestrator.cpp with structure validation (5 tests, 16 assertions)
*   Fixed test/test_midi_loader.cpp file paths (fixtures/ -> test/fixtures/)
*   Created comprehensive test design documentation (PHASE2_PLAYBACK_TEST_DESIGN.md)
*   Created Phase 2 completion summary (PHASE2_FINAL_SUMMARY.md)
*   Updated test/README.md with accurate test statistics
*   All 60 test cases pass (251 assertions, 100% pass rate)
