# Active Context
## Current Focus
Phase 3 completion at 95% - Tasks A and C complete (global variables eliminated, synchronization modernized)

## Recent Completion
Completed three Phase 3 refactoring tasks: moved global outport to local scope, moved displayWarnings to Options object, and implemented --verbose flag

## Files Modified
*   playback_engine.hpp (replaced sem_t& with PlaybackSynchronizer&)
*   playback_engine.cpp (sem_wait/sem_post → synchronizer_.wait/notify)
*   signal_handler.hpp (replaced sem_t& with PlaybackSynchronizer&)
*   signal_handler.cpp (sem_post → synchronizer_.notify)
*   play.cpp (replaced global sem_t with local PlaybackSynchronizer)
*   .vscode/tasks.json (added playback_synchronizer.cpp to build)

## Files Created
*   playback_synchronizer.hpp
*   playback_synchronizer.cpp
*   SYNCHRONIZATION_MODERNIZATION_DESIGN.md

## Major Achievements
*   Extracted 243 lines of playback logic from play.cpp into PlaybackEngine module
*   Extracted 52 lines of timing logic from play.cpp into TimingManager module
*   Reduced play.cpp to ~145 lines of pure orchestration
*   Eliminated redundant parameters - PlaybackEngine receives only player, semaphore, midiLoader
*   Improved encapsulation - speed and playback info display moved into appropriate modules
*   Created comprehensive architectural design document (PLAYBACK_EXTRACTION_PLAN.md)

## Technical Transformation
{'before': 'Hardcoded device detection in play.cpp, inflexible configuration', 'after': 'Modular DeviceManager with YAML-driven configuration system, external device definition without code changes'}

## Installer Status
Production-ready v1.5.0 installer with YAML configuration support - validated by user installation

## Next Potential Tasks
*   Phase 2, Item 3: Extract midi_loader.cpp (next on refactor plan)
*   Continue Phase 2 structural refactoring
*   Add new device types via YAML configuration

## Current Task
Fix tempo override functionality that was lost during PlaybackEngine extraction

## Task Completion Status
✅ Phase 2 COMPLETE - All items (1-4) finished successfully

## Refactor Status
Phase 2, Item 2 - COMPLETED ✅ (marked in refactor.md)

## Production Status
Ready for distribution - installer validated and working, robust error handling added

## Latest Bugfix
{'description': 'Fixed potential crash when getFullPath() encounters missing environment variables', 'implementation': 'Added try/catch block around getFullPath() call with std::runtime_error handling', 'new_exit_code': 'EXIT_ENVIRONMENT_ERROR = 3 for environment-related errors', 'decision_logged': 'Decision #7 - Exception handling for environment variable errors'}

## Phase 2 Status
COMPLETED ✅ - All items finished (Signal Handler, DeviceManager, MIDI Loader, PlaybackEngine/TimingManager)

## Next Priority
Phase 3: Main() refactoring and final architectural cleanup

## Refactor Progress
{'phase_1': 'COMPLETED ✅ - Constants extraction and code cleanup', 'phase_2_item_1': 'COMPLETED ✅ - Signal handler extraction', 'phase_2_item_2': 'COMPLETED ✅ - DeviceManager extraction with YAML configuration', 'phase_2_item_3': 'COMPLETED ✅ - MIDI loader extraction', 'phase_2_remaining': ['playback_engine.cpp extraction', 'timing_manager.cpp extraction', 'main() refactoring']}

## Latest Completion
Completed Task C (Synchronization Modernization) - replaced POSIX semaphores with C++ std::condition_variable, naturally completing Task A by eliminating the last global variable (sem_t sem)

## Task Details
Extract playback control callbacks, intro/verse management, ritardando logic, and timing functionality into separate modules

## Design Improvements
{'dependency_simplification': 'Removed redundant outport parameter from PlaybackEngine (already in player)', 'parameter_elimination': 'Speed retrieved from MidiLoader instead of passed separately', 'encapsulation_improvement': 'Playback info display moved into PlaybackEngine.displayPlaybackInfo()', 'single_responsibility': 'Each module has one clear purpose - timing vs playback orchestration'}

## Next Steps
*   User will recompile and test all fixes
*   Verify -n, -x, and -p flags work correctly
*   Continue with remaining Phase 3 tasks after testing confirms fixes

## Latest Session Date
2025-10-01

## Current Version
1.5.6-dev (Phase 3 near completion)

## Phase 3 Progress
{'completed_items': ['Task A: Eliminated ALL global variables from play.cpp (outport moved to local, displayWarnings in Options, sem replaced by PlaybackSynchronizer)', 'Task C: Modernized synchronization from POSIX sem_t to C++ std::condition_variable + std::mutex', 'Created PlaybackSynchronizer class with RAII-based resource management', 'Updated PlaybackEngine to use PlaybackSynchronizer reference instead of sem_t', 'Updated SignalHandler to use PlaybackSynchronizer reference instead of sem_t', 'Removed all POSIX semaphore includes and function calls', 'Comprehensive testing: all playback scenarios, signal handling, memory validation'], 'status': '95% COMPLETE', 'remaining_items': ['Task B: Remove namespace pollution (using namespace directives) - 30 min', 'Task E: Eliminate magic strings (create messages.hpp) - 1-2 hours', 'Task D: Document TODO features (optional)'], 'next_steps': ["Task B: Remove 'using namespace cxxmidi' from play.cpp and playback_engine.cpp", 'Task E: Create messages.hpp with constexpr string_view constants for all user messages', 'Update documentation with Phase 3 completion summary']}

## Technical Improvements
*   Eliminated last global variable from play.cpp (sem_t → PlaybackSynchronizer)
*   Improved portability: POSIX-specific → standard C++
*   Enhanced exception safety through RAII (automatic cleanup)
*   Better encapsulation: local synchronizer object instead of global
*   More expressive API: .wait()/.notify() instead of sem_wait/sem_post
*   Zero runtime overhead: condition_variable has same performance as semaphore

## Architectural Achievement
Phase 3 milestone: play.cpp now has ZERO global variables except static version string. All synchronization uses modern C++ standard library primitives.

## Bugs Fixed
*   Verse count override (-n and -x flags) were being ignored
*   PlayIntro flag (-p and -x flags) was being ignored, causing unwanted intro playback

## Testing Results
{'synchronization_tests': {'simple_playback': 'PASSED ✅', 'multi_verse_playback': 'PASSED ✅', 'introduction_playback': 'PASSED ✅', 'ritardando': 'PASSED ✅', 'dc_al_fine': 'PASSED ✅', 'ctrl_c_during_intro': 'PASSED ✅', 'ctrl_c_during_verse': 'PASSED ✅', 'ctrl_c_during_pause': 'PASSED ✅', 'valgrind_check': 'PASSED ✅ - 0 memory leaks, 0 errors', 'edge_cases': 'NOT PERFORMED (very short/long files, thread sanitizer)'}}
