# Active Context
## Current Focus
Phase 2 refactoring - Item 3 COMPLETED, ready for Phase 2, Item 4

## Recent Completion
Added exception handling for getFullPath() environment variable errors with appropriate exit codes

## Files Modified
*   play.cpp
*   constants.hpp
*   midiplay-installer/debian-package/DEBIAN/control
*   midiplay-installer/debian-package/DEBIAN/postinst
*   midiplay-installer/install.sh
*   midiplay-installer/README.md
*   create-installer-archive.sh
*   README.md
*   refactor.md

## Files Created
*   device_manager.hpp
*   device_manager.cpp
*   midi_devices.yaml
*   DEVICE_MANAGER_API.md
*   INSTALLER_UPDATE_PLAN.md
*   midiplay-installer/debian-package/etc/midiplay/midi_devices.yaml

## Major Achievements
*   Extracted 45 lines of device management code from play.cpp into modular DeviceManager
*   Implemented factory pattern for device creation with YAML configuration
*   Added priority-based YAML configuration discovery (current dir → user config → system config)
*   Achieved 100% independence from legacy device headers (ctx3000.hpp, psr-ew425.hpp, protege.hpp)
*   Created comprehensive YAML configuration system with device detection strings and MIDI channel mapping
*   Updated installer system to v1.5.0 with libyaml-cpp0.7 dependency
*   Fixed installer binary/dependency mismatches and verified successful installation
*   Created complete documentation with API guides and troubleshooting
*   Updated refactor.md to mark Phase 2, Item 2 as completed

## Technical Transformation
{'before': 'Hardcoded device detection in play.cpp, inflexible configuration', 'after': 'Modular DeviceManager with YAML-driven configuration system, external device definition without code changes'}

## Installer Status
Production-ready v1.5.0 installer with YAML configuration support - validated by user installation

## Next Potential Tasks
*   Phase 2, Item 3: Extract midi_loader.cpp (next on refactor plan)
*   Continue Phase 2 structural refactoring
*   Add new device types via YAML configuration

## Current Task
READY for next task - Exception handling bugfix completed

## Task Completion Status
✅ Phase 2, Items 1-3 COMPLETE - Ready for playback engine extraction

## Refactor Status
Phase 2, Item 2 - COMPLETED ✅ (marked in refactor.md)

## Production Status
Ready for distribution - installer validated and working, robust error handling added

## Latest Bugfix
{'description': 'Fixed potential crash when getFullPath() encounters missing environment variables', 'implementation': 'Added try/catch block around getFullPath() call with std::runtime_error handling', 'new_exit_code': 'EXIT_ENVIRONMENT_ERROR = 3 for environment-related errors', 'decision_logged': 'Decision #7 - Exception handling for environment variable errors'}

## Phase 2 Status
Items 1-3 COMPLETED ✅ - Signal Handler, DeviceManager, and MIDI Loader extractions complete

## Next Priority
Phase 2, Item 4: Extract playback_engine.cpp and timing_manager.cpp modules

## Refactor Progress
{'phase_1': 'COMPLETED ✅ - Constants extraction and code cleanup', 'phase_2_item_1': 'COMPLETED ✅ - Signal handler extraction', 'phase_2_item_2': 'COMPLETED ✅ - DeviceManager extraction with YAML configuration', 'phase_2_item_3': 'COMPLETED ✅ - MIDI loader extraction', 'phase_2_remaining': ['playback_engine.cpp extraction', 'timing_manager.cpp extraction', 'main() refactoring']}

## Latest Completion
MIDI loader successfully extracted into midi_loader.hpp/.cpp
