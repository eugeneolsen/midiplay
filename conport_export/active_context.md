# Active Context
## Current Focus
Phase 2 Business Logic testing complete. All 195 assertions in 43 test cases passing. Ready to proceed with Phase 3 (Integration Tests) or other development priorities.

## Recent Changes
*   Completed Phase 2 Business Logic tests - MidiLoader component (11 test cases, 40 assertions)
*   Fixed callback dangling reference bug in midi_loader.cpp (Decision D-70)
*   Fixed getopt global state pollution across all test files (Decision D-71)
*   Created comprehensive CLI11 migration plan (Decision D-72, D-73)
*   Updated UNIT_TESTING_STRATEGY.md with Phase 2 completion status
*   Updated PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md with complete documentation
*   Entire test suite stable: 195 assertions in 43 test cases - 100% pass rate

## Open Issues

## Key Learnings
*   Lambda captures by reference in callbacks can cause dangling references when captured objects go out of scope
*   Options class contains char** argv_ pointer that shouldn't be copied - requires careful lifetime management
*   Callback lifecycle must be managed defensively: clear in resetState(), after Load(), in destructor, and in error paths
*   getopt() uses global state (optind) that must be reset (optind=0) before each test for proper isolation
*   Using optind=0 (GNU complete reinitialization) is more reliable than optind=1 (POSIX) for test isolation
*   Test execution order can expose state pollution issues - always verify tests pass in random order
*   Modern C++ libraries like CLI11 eliminate global state issues and provide better type safety

## Next Steps
*   Consider implementing Phase 3 Integration Tests (PlaybackOrchestrator, MusicalDirector, RitardandoEffector)
*   Optional: Implement CLI11 migration to modernize command-line parsing
*   Continue with other development priorities as needed
