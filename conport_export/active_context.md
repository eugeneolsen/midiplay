# Active Context
## Current Focus
Phase 2, Item 2 FULLY COMPLETED - DeviceManager + YAML Configuration + Complete Installer System

## Recent Completion
Successfully completed comprehensive DeviceManager refactoring with YAML configuration system and production-ready installer

## Files Modified
*   play.cpp
*   midiplay-installer/debian-package/DEBIAN/control
*   midiplay-installer/debian-package/DEBIAN/postinst
*   midiplay-installer/install.sh
*   midiplay-installer/README.md
*   create-installer-archive.sh
*   README.md
*   refactor.md

## Files Created
*   device_manager.hpp
*   device_manager.cpp
*   midi_devices.yaml
*   DEVICE_MANAGER_API.md
*   INSTALLER_UPDATE_PLAN.md
*   midiplay-installer/debian-package/etc/midiplay/midi_devices.yaml

## Major Achievements
*   Extracted 45 lines of device management code from play.cpp into modular DeviceManager
*   Implemented factory pattern for device creation with YAML configuration
*   Added priority-based YAML configuration discovery (current dir → user config → system config)
*   Achieved 100% independence from legacy device headers (ctx3000.hpp, psr-ew425.hpp, protege.hpp)
*   Created comprehensive YAML configuration system with device detection strings and MIDI channel mapping
*   Updated installer system to v1.5.0 with libyaml-cpp0.7 dependency
*   Fixed installer binary/dependency mismatches and verified successful installation
*   Created complete documentation with API guides and troubleshooting
*   Updated refactor.md to mark Phase 2, Item 2 as completed

## Technical Transformation
{'before': 'Hardcoded device detection in play.cpp, inflexible configuration', 'after': 'Modular DeviceManager with YAML-driven configuration system, external device definition without code changes'}

## Installer Status
Production-ready v1.5.0 installer with YAML configuration support - validated by user installation

## Next Potential Tasks
*   Phase 2, Item 3: Extract midi_loader.cpp (next on refactor plan)
*   Continue Phase 2 structural refactoring
*   Add new device types via YAML configuration

## Current Task
COMPLETED - Device Manager Extraction + YAML Configuration + Installer Updates

## Task Completion Status
✅ FULLY COMPLETE

## Refactor Status
Phase 2, Item 2 - COMPLETED ✅ (marked in refactor.md)

## Production Status
Ready for distribution - installer validated and working
