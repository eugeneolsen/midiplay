# Active Context
## Current Focus
Phase 3: Main() refactoring - improving encapsulation and configuration management

## Recent Completion
Completed three Phase 3 refactoring tasks: moved global outport to local scope, moved displayWarnings to Options object, and implemented --verbose flag

## Files Modified
*   play.cpp
*   options.hpp

## Files Created
*   timing_manager.hpp
*   timing_manager.cpp
*   playback_engine.hpp
*   playback_engine.cpp
*   PLAYBACK_EXTRACTION_PLAN.md

## Major Achievements
*   Extracted 243 lines of playback logic from play.cpp into PlaybackEngine module
*   Extracted 52 lines of timing logic from play.cpp into TimingManager module
*   Reduced play.cpp to ~145 lines of pure orchestration
*   Eliminated redundant parameters - PlaybackEngine receives only player, semaphore, midiLoader
*   Improved encapsulation - speed and playback info display moved into appropriate modules
*   Created comprehensive architectural design document (PLAYBACK_EXTRACTION_PLAN.md)

## Technical Transformation
{'before': 'Hardcoded device detection in play.cpp, inflexible configuration', 'after': 'Modular DeviceManager with YAML-driven configuration system, external device definition without code changes'}

## Installer Status
Production-ready v1.5.0 installer with YAML configuration support - validated by user installation

## Next Potential Tasks
*   Phase 2, Item 3: Extract midi_loader.cpp (next on refactor plan)
*   Continue Phase 2 structural refactoring
*   Add new device types via YAML configuration

## Current Task
Fix tempo override functionality that was lost during PlaybackEngine extraction

## Task Completion Status
✅ Phase 2 COMPLETE - All items (1-4) finished successfully

## Refactor Status
Phase 2, Item 2 - COMPLETED ✅ (marked in refactor.md)

## Production Status
Ready for distribution - installer validated and working, robust error handling added

## Latest Bugfix
{'description': 'Fixed potential crash when getFullPath() encounters missing environment variables', 'implementation': 'Added try/catch block around getFullPath() call with std::runtime_error handling', 'new_exit_code': 'EXIT_ENVIRONMENT_ERROR = 3 for environment-related errors', 'decision_logged': 'Decision #7 - Exception handling for environment variable errors'}

## Phase 2 Status
COMPLETED ✅ - All items finished (Signal Handler, DeviceManager, MIDI Loader, PlaybackEngine/TimingManager)

## Next Priority
Phase 3: Main() refactoring and final architectural cleanup

## Refactor Progress
{'phase_1': 'COMPLETED ✅ - Constants extraction and code cleanup', 'phase_2_item_1': 'COMPLETED ✅ - Signal handler extraction', 'phase_2_item_2': 'COMPLETED ✅ - DeviceManager extraction with YAML configuration', 'phase_2_item_3': 'COMPLETED ✅ - MIDI loader extraction', 'phase_2_remaining': ['playback_engine.cpp extraction', 'timing_manager.cpp extraction', 'main() refactoring']}

## Latest Completion
Fixed tempo override bug - PlaybackEngine now fully functional with all features tested and working

## Task Details
Extract playback control callbacks, intro/verse management, ritardando logic, and timing functionality into separate modules

## Design Improvements
{'dependency_simplification': 'Removed redundant outport parameter from PlaybackEngine (already in player)', 'parameter_elimination': 'Speed retrieved from MidiLoader instead of passed separately', 'encapsulation_improvement': 'Playback info display moved into PlaybackEngine.displayPlaybackInfo()', 'single_responsibility': 'Each module has one clear purpose - timing vs playback orchestration'}

## Next Steps
*   Debug and fix --tempo override functionality
*   Complete manual testing of all playback features
*   Mark Phase 2, Item 4 as complete once tempo override is fixed
*   Proceed to Phase 3: main() refactoring

## Latest Session Date
2025-10-01

## Current Version
1.5.5

## Phase 3 Progress
{'completed_items': ['Moved global outport declaration to local scope in main() for better encapsulation', 'Moved displayWarnings flag from global/parameter passing to Options object', 'Implemented --verbose (-V) command-line flag for enhanced debugging output'], 'status': 'IN_PROGRESS', 'next_steps': ['Continue main() refactoring and cleanup', 'Review remaining global state and refactor as needed', 'Complete Phase 3 architectural improvements']}

## Technical Improvements
*   Reduced global state by moving outport to local scope
*   Improved Options object encapsulation with displayWarnings and verbose flags
*   Enhanced user experience with optional verbose debugging output
*   Better configuration management with all CLI options centralized in Options class
