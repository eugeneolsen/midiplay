# üéπ Organ Pi üéú MIDI File Player
## C++ (gnu++20 standard), customized fork of [cxxmidi](https://github.com/eugeneolsen/cxxmidi), standard library.
## üëâüèΩ See a demo video in the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-is-this-churchs-new-organist/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi News</a>
## Description
The Organ Pi MIDI file player is a software MIDI sequencer that plays a MIDI file through MIDI OUT port 1 through a USB-to-MIDI converter.  This program was developed specifically to run on a Raspberry Pi 4B (or better) running Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit (or any Debian Linux derivative, such as Ubuntu) through a USB to MIDI adapter to an Allen Prot√©g√©-16 organ.  Other organs may be supported in the future.

Currently, Casio and Yamaha consumer keyboards are also supported for testing.

This project was created for people with technical aptitude.  A more user-friendly touch-screen interface is in the works.

## Features
‚úÖ Simple Linux command line syntax.<br>
‚úÖ Define an introduction using MIDI markers.<br>
‚úÖ Play the number of verses defined in the MIDI file or overridden on the command line.<br>
‚úÖ Command line flags for prelude and postlude without playing the introduction.<br>

## System Requirements
- Raspberry Pi 4B or better.  The Orange Pi 5 family of single-board computers has also been tested with success.
- 64-bit Debian 12 (Bookworm) or later.  Raspberry Pi OS based on Debian 12 works fine.
- 4GB RAM (may require less RAM; hasn't been tested with less).
- NVME SSD recommended but performs respectably with a fast SD card or flash memory.
- Allen Prot√©g√©-16 organ.  Other Allen organ models may work but have not been tested.

## Installation
For installation instructions, see the [installer documentation](midiplay-installer/README.md).

## Usage 
On the Linux or SSH command line, type:

`play` *<filename\>* *options*

*filename* need not include the extension ".mid".  The extension ".mid" is appended if not present in the *filename.*

It is recommended that aliases be added to `~/.bash_aliases` as follows:

`alias p='play'`

For Spanish and Portuguese:

`alias toque='play'`<br>
`alias toq='play'`<br>
`alias t='play'`



### Options
`-v --version`  Display the version number of this command.

`-p`*n* `--prelude=`*n* play two verses *without* the introduction as prelude or postlude where *n* indicates the speed at which to play, 10 being the tempo in the MIDI file.  The default if no number is provided for the option is 8, which is 80% of the tempo in the MIDI file.

`-n`*n* where *n* is the number of verses to play *after* the introduction.  Overrides the default number of verses specified in the MIDI file with player-specific meta event type 0x01 (see below).

`-t`*bpm*` --tempo=`*bpm*  overrides the tempo specified in the MIDI file,
where *bpm* is beats per minute.

`-x`*n* where *n* is the number of verses to play *without* an introduction.  Overrides the default number of verses specified in the MIDI file with player-specific meta event type 0x01 (see below).

## Player-Specific Meta Events
The play command uses custom MIDI Meta events to inform playback options for single-verse MIDI files.  They are used at time zero in track zero. These events are optional but helpful.  They are not sent to the connected playback device.

The Sequencer-Specific Meta Event, 0xFF7F is used as follows:

`0xFF7F` Sequencer-Specific Meta Event<br>
`length` per MIDI variable length standard<br>
`0x7D` Private, prototyping, experimental, or test event. Private to this custom player.<br>
`byte` event type<br>
`data`

Currently supported **event types** are:

`0x01` number of verses. Data = ASCII character '1' ‚Äì '9'<br>
`0x02` pause between verses.  Data = unsigned 16-bit integer indicating the number of MIDI clock ticks to pause.

Examples:

`0x00FF7F037D0134` Play 4 verses.<br>
`0x00FF7F047d020524` Pause for 1,320 ticks between verses.

#### *The following custom meta events currently work but are deprecated as they may conflict with current and future MIDI specifications:*

FF 0x10 01 <i>n</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Number of Verses</b>

>>*n* specifies the number of verses to play.

<br>
FF 0x11 02 <i>tttt</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp <b>Pause Between Verses</b>

>>*tttt* specifies the number of ticks to pause between verses, including between the introduction and the first verse.
